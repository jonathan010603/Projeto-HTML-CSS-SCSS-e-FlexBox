[Development]

Initially, I created a layout with Figma, based on the course's layout

I created the logo using Canva's presets and some styling

After the project was ready, I started to change the styles and test some colors. In the end, the final layout was a little distant from the Figma layout.

So I started to make it responsive (what I consider an error, think I should have used Mobile First design).

Now it's deployed to GitHub Pages, and you can test it.
